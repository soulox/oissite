# WHMCS SSL Certificate Issue Fix

## üö® **Issue Identified**
The error `"Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel"` indicates an SSL certificate problem with your WHMCS server.

## üîç **Root Cause**
- **SSL Certificate Issue**: The SSL certificate on `secure.outsourceis.com` is either:
  - Self-signed
  - Expired
  - Not trusted by your system
  - Has certificate chain issues

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Update WHMCS Client to Handle SSL Issues**

I'll update the WHMCS client to ignore SSL certificate errors for development/testing purposes.

### **Solution 2: Fix SSL Certificate (Recommended for Production)**

1. **Check SSL Certificate**:
   - Visit `https://secure.outsourceis.com` in your browser
   - Check if you get an SSL warning
   - Look at the certificate details

2. **Fix SSL Certificate**:
   - Install a valid SSL certificate
   - Ensure certificate chain is complete
   - Use a trusted Certificate Authority (Let's Encrypt, etc.)

### **Solution 3: Use HTTP Instead of HTTPS (Development Only)**

For testing purposes, you could temporarily use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

## üîß **Immediate Fix for Development**

I'll update the WHMCS client to handle SSL certificate issues by adding SSL verification bypass for development.

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **I'll update the WHMCS client** to handle SSL issues
2. **Test the connection** again
3. **For production**, fix the SSL certificate on your WHMCS server

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**

Bypassing SSL verification is only for development/testing. For production, you should fix the SSL certificate issue properly.
